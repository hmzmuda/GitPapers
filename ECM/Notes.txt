Yamada_2000_FN_CellMigration
-"Normal wound repair depends on moleculles like fibronectin to promote cell adhesion and migration"
-FN aguments cell migration?
-Looks at a higher affinity ligand of finbronectin as a potential wound healing tool, not mechanistic
Wang_2000_FNActivatesThp1
-Adherence to fibronectin dramatically modulates the effects of TDF-beta1 on Thp1
-Did not use PMA to stimulate, only TGF-beta
