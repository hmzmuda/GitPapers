Notes on "Modular actin nano-arcitecture enables podosome protrusion and mechanosensing"
Terms and core concepts:
-invadosomes = collective term for invadopodia and podosomes
-Podosomes are characterised by actin-rich core and surrounded by an adhesive ring (vinculin and talin)
	Neighboring podosomes are interconnected by a network of bundled actin filaments that
	radiate from the podosome core and facilitate a mesoscale connectivity
-vinculin = Vinculin is a cytoskeletal protein associated with cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions, where it is thought to function as one of several interacting proteins involved in anchoring F-actin to the membrane.
cPM = central part of the podosome core
pPM = core periphery (slightly out, Fig 1c)
-previously shown that blocking myosin IIA (using blebbistatin) arrested podosome pushing behavior and mesoscale coordination, but the organization of the mechanosensitive proteins zyxin and vinculin remained unaltered
Goal of the paper:
-reveal actin nano-architecture that enables podosome protrusion and mechanosensing
-how podosome mechanosensing relates to podosome mesocale connectivity and degrative capacitiy remains elusive
-
Interesting Methods:
-doing radial fluorescence profile analysis to observe wheter WASP is expressed inside the actin or in another area
	found it is expressed inside the actin
Main Results:
-the 700nm podosome core consists of two distinct components: (1) a branched beta-actin-rich central module (cPM) where WASP, cortiactin, and Arp2/3 are found, and 
(2) a linear gamma-actin-rich periperal module (pPM) which completely encases the cPM and is crosslinked by alpha-actinin and partially bound by vinculin

Interesting info:
-WASP, arp2/3 and cortactin associate with branched actin while alpha-actinin primarily associates with linear actin filaments
